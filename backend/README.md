# TL Challenge Backend

This project has been made using Node.js with Typescript, developed with ESLint and nodemon. It uses Express to handle incoming HTTP calls, pino.js for logging purposes, Axios to communicate with 3rd-party services and Jest for testing.

## Project structure
This project follows a Controller - Service - Repository pattern as following:

#### Controllers
Controllers are just meant to validate incoming HTTP request, interact with services and then send back an answer to the requester. Requests are being validated using express-validator which also provides an effective returning error when validation fails.

#### Services
Services interact with repositories, getting data from repositories and applying the required business logic in order to send it back to the controller.

#### Repositories
Repositories are in charge of retrieving data from third-party services, which in this case are FunTranslations and Pokeapi APIs

#### Custom exceptions
While the original error is being logged by Pino, they provide a way to send a readable and useful answer back to the client. When a repository API call fails, or when service is not able to apply business logic to incoming external data, controllers will still be able to send a meaningful response back to the client.

#### Others
Beside the above, there is an HttpClient which underlies axios, a Logger which underlies pino.js and a simple error handler which gets used within the last Express middleware (only when an error is being thrown back at controllers)

## How to run it
As is comes with a Dockerfile, it can be built and run using Docker.
Express server is being exposed by default on port 6556 which can be changed (following next)

```
docker build . -t your_image_name
docker run docker run -p 4001:6556 your_image_name
```
There is also a handy makefile which can be used for both operations. Issuing `make build-and-run` in your terminal will execute the docker commands above with a default image name of `tl-pokemon-backend:local`

You can check if it's running by visiting `http://localhost:6556` (or the port you've chosen), server should answer with a welcome message.

### Running tests
Tests written with Jest can be run using `npm run test`

#### Available configuration

Following here default runtime environment variables which can be changed  

| Variable Name | Default Value |
|---------------|---------------|
| SERVER_HOST   | 0.0.0.0       |
| SERVER_PORT   | 6556          |
| LOG_LEVEL     | debug         |
  

## Available endpoints

| Path              | Description                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|
| /                 | Show welcome page                   |
| /healthcheck/ping | Can be used for healthcheck         |
| /pokemon/:name    | Retrieve info about pokemon ${name} |

 
### Example request

```
$ curl http://localhost:{SERVER_PORT}/pokemon/celebi
{
	"name":"celebi",
	"sprite":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/251.png",
	"description":"This pok√©mon wan ders across time. Grass and trees flourish in the forests in which 't hath did doth appear."
}
```

### Error codes
| Http Code | Error Code          | Description                                                  |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 404       | `pokemon_not_found` | The pokemon you were searching for was not found on PokeAPIs |
| 500       | `translation_error` | There was an error calling FunTranslations APIs              |
| 500       | `server_error`      | An unhandled server error has occurred                       |

## Possible Improvements
Here are a few topics that could be implemented/improved within this project, which weren't considered due to the limited amount of time.

#### Caching
As external services are returning read-only static data, they are definetly suitable for caching. Maybe starting from a in-memory cache on the service itself could be a good starting point for something much proper like Redis. Also, cache headers should be sent back to the client itself.

#### More specific error handling / definition
FunTranslations API have a limit of 5 API calls/hour, which is now being handled as a TranslationError returning a 500 HTTP Status. Handling a 429 HTTP Status in a different way (a new custom error code, returning 429 to the client) would be more appropriate.

#### Repositories reliability
Using an incremental retry strategy for temporary errors would make calling external Pokeapi API or FunTranslations API more reliable.

####  Tracing
Requests could be marked with a unique Trace ID in order to better handle a request's lifespan from the HTTP call to the response itself. It will make finding bugs, bottlenecks or other issues much easy.

#### Metrics
In a production-ready environment, metrics are key. We could store data related to the number of external API calls, cache hits and response timings.

#### Translations
Express could read `accept-language` headers to decide which description to pick from PokeAPI instead of picking `en` language only.

#### Test container
Tests could also be ran using a different Docker build and container, without having `npm` on your machine.
